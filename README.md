# ft_printf
 <h2>:star2: About The Project</h2>
  <p>
   The main goal of the project is to recreate the C standard library printf function, understanding about variadic functions being the academic goal. The function ft_printf should be able to take an indefinite number of parameters, the first of which is always a string. The flags that the function must handle are cspdiuxX%. It is not necessary to implement the buffer management of the original printf().
